Human Recognition Analysis

Overview

The Human Recognition Analysis project is designed to classify and analyze human recognition data using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes Apache Spark and Apache Kafka for data processing and streaming. Four machine learning algorithms are implemented alongside a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for robust performance.

Features

Implementation of four machine learning algorithms for classification.

Use of LSTM for deep learning-based sequential data analysis.

Integration of Apache Spark for scalable data processing.

Use of Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.8 or higher

Apache Spark

Apache Kafka

Required Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

tensorflow/keras

pyspark

kafka-python

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/human-recognition-analysis.git
cd human-recognition-analysis

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up Apache Spark and Apache Kafka:

Follow the official installation guides for Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.

Start the Kafka broker and Spark master node before running the project.

Usage

Step 1: Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset and place it in the data directory. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and ready for analysis.

Step 2: Running the Project

Start the Kafka server:

kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Submit the Spark job:

spark-submit main.py

The results, including model predictions and performance metrics, will be saved in the output directory.

Algorithms Used

Machine Learning

Algorithm 1: Logistic Regression

Algorithm 2: Random Forest

Algorithm 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Algorithm 4: Gradient Boosting

Deep Learning

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Used for analyzing sequential data to capture temporal dependencies.

Results

The project evaluates the performance of each model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The LSTM model is specifically used for tasks requiring sequential data analysis.
