Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure your system is ready with the following:

Python 3.8 or higher

Apache Spark

Apache Kafka

Essential Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

tensorflow/keras

pyspark

kafka-python

Installation

Clone this repository to get started:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/human-recognition-analysis.git
cd human-recognition-analysis

Install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up Spark and Kafka environments:

Follow the official guides for Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.

Ensure your Kafka broker and Spark master node are running.

How to Use

Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Organize your dataset in the data directory. Ensure it is preprocessed and ready for analysis.

Step 2: Run the Project

Start Kafka to handle real-time streaming:

kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Launch the Spark job for scalable data processing:

spark-submit main.py

Find your results, including predictions and metrics, in the output directory.

Behind the Scenes

Machine Learning Magic

Logistic Regression: Simplicity meets accuracy.

Random Forest: Harness the power of ensemble learning.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Precision-driven classification.

Gradient Boosting: Mastering complex data patterns.

Deep Learning Brilliance

LSTM: Unlock the potential of temporal data with Long Short-Term Memory networks.

Results That Matter

We evaluate all models with metrics that matter: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Dive deeper into sequential data analysis with our LSTM model for insights like never before.
